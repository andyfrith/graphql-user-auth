## Introduction

This very light application serves as simple demo of several technologies and best-practices with respect to React and GraphQL development. It is designed to operate alongside the GraphQL server provided by the demo-gql application.

## Features

A list of movies are diplayed when opening [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in the browser.

### Tyepscript

Why TypeScript? Because, use of types lends itself to using highly-productive development tools and practices; such as, static checking and code refactoring during JavaScript development. Additionally, there is great support for TypeScript in the development community.

### React

Why React? Because there is no better JavaScript library for building the best user interfaces!

### GraphQL

This application was built using the [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/v3.0-beta/get-started/).

## Environment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Installs the necessary modules required to build and run the application.

#### `npm generate`

Generates GraphQL schema by running the the [Apollo CLI](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/devtools/cli/).

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
